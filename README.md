# 🧠 Stock Analysis using RAG & Hugging Face LLM

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for stock analysis using **Hugging Face's LLMs** and **LangChain**, integrated with **FAISS** and **MiniLM embeddings**. The system is designed to analyze data from [Screener.in](https://www.screener.in/) and offer insightful financial recommendations backed by both **live data** and **domain-specific documents**.
